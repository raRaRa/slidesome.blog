This means that Instagram personal accounts are no longer able to use third party applications like Slidesome to fetch hashtagged media. What this means for Slidesome users is that from December 11th only Instagram Business and Creator accounts will be able to create an Instagram #hashtag slideshow. 

This change doesn’t affect users who post photos with a hashtag, we are able to fetch hashtagged posts from anyone who has a public Instagram profile. This change only affects how you setup the slideshow in Slidesome. You will need to add Instagram feed in Slidesome and then select Hashtag feed under Choose feed.

It's free to set up an Instagram Creator or Business account, or to convert your Instagram personal account to a Creator or Business account. Here is a step by step guide on how to create a Creator or Business account: https://www.facebook.com/help/502981923235522 

You need to connect a Facebook Page to your Instagram Professional account in order for it to work. It is relatively easy to set up a new Page on Facebook, either for your business or your event. Simply visit settings on Facebook, select Manage pages, Create a Page and follow the instructions. You will then be able to select that Facebook Page when you convert your personal Instagram account to a Creator or Business account.

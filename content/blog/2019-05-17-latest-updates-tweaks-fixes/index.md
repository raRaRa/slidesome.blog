- The navigation for your slideshow and account pages is now on the left side which makes it easily accessible whenever you are editing your slideshow or making adjustments to your account details.

- The Posts page has been renamed to “*Manage Posts*” and Custom posts is now on a separate page and can be found in the left navigation menu.

- We have added the ability to change the header text. Simply click on *Header* in the Designer and then add your own slideshow header text.

- The snapshot template has been updated to utilise the space better on all screen sizes. For the best results go into Settings in the Designer, click on the *Slideshow* tab and set all the slideshow margins to 0.

We hope you like these changes!

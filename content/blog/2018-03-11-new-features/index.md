> Please note that we are only able to fetch stories from an Instagram Creator or Business account from the last 24 hours.

The new slideshow template is called Snapshots, you can find it in the Designer under Templates. There are two transitions available, float up and zoom down. You can find them under Transitions after you have changed the template to Snapshots. We will continue to improve this new template over time, and create new ones.

You can customize the look of the Snapshots, such as change the background, hide the poster avatar, increase the font size and more in the Designer.

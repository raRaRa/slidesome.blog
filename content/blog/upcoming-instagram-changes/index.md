The Instagram team is deprecating their old legacy API on the 31st of March, which will be replaced with their brand new Instagram Basic Display API. We have already made the necessary changes on Slidesome and we have also been approved to use the new API.

The only thing you’ll need to do is migrate your Instagram personal profile feed by the 31st of March. The steps to migrate your feed are simple:

1. Sign in to your Slidesome account.
2. Locate the slideshow and open the Feeds page for your slideshow.
3. Remove the personal Instagram profile feed.
4. Add the personal Instagram profile feed.

There’s only one thing missing in their brand new API, which is profile pictures. We have already sent the Instagram team feedback on this and we hope that profiles pictures for personal profile feed will return in the future.

We apologize for the inconvenience this may cause. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

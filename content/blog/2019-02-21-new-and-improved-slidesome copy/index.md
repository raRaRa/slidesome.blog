> The technology stack that runs Slidesome has also been updated, which will unlock many new features in the future such as embedding slideshows on websites.

You can now choose from three day event plans as well as monthly and annual subscriptions. The annual subscription gives you a saving of two months. [Check out our pricing plans](https://slidesome.com/pricing/).

We have added integration to <a href="https://unsplash.com" target="_blank">Unsplash</a> in the designer, which gives you access to free photos that you can use as backgrounds in your slideshow. We have also added the ability to add custom text and display name to individual posts, edit the text on the information post in the designer plus a lot of other tweaks and fixes.

The Google Photos feed has also been updated. We can now display shared albums and shared photos and videos. This means that you can now share an album with your friends and have them upload media which will be displayed in your slideshow.

We hope you like the new look and feel of Slidesome! Donâ€™t hesitate to [contact us](https://slidesome.com/contact/) if you have any questions or feedback.

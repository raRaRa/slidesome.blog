title: Update to our pricing plans
date: "2018-01-16"
description: Slidesome has grown a lot in features over the past year which were all provisionally added to the Awesome plan. Instead of having just one paid plan and increasing the price of that, we decided to discontinue the Awesome plan and create two new pricing plans that are more focused for our customer needs.

Our free Basic plan still remains free of charge with all of its previous features.

**The new Plus plan** includes all the features in the Basic plan as well as the designer, which gives you the option to customize your slideshow, create one custom post, remove branding from the information post and create an admin link that you can share with someone you trust to moderate and update your slideshow, without having to sign in.

**The Professional plan** includes all features in the Basic and Plus plans as well as giving our customers the ability to; completely remove branding, create more custom posts, create unique public link to your slideshow, advanced moderation, and add custom CSS code in the designer.

If you are a an existing customer and have an active Awesome plan then this pricing change won't affect you. **All active Awesome plan customers will be automatically upgraded to the Professional plan with no extra cost as a thank you for being a part of Slidesome from the start**.

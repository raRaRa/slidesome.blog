Not only that, the media will be uploaded directly to your Google Drive folder or Google Photos album, and you will own all the media that will be uploaded through our website or mobile app.

How does it work? You enable the feature by Editing or Creating a new slideshow, scroll down to “Allow adding posts through Slidesome” and click on “Enable”. You first have to enter a unique key for your slideshow. Then choose where the media will be uploaded, either Google Drive folder or Google Photos album, and you’re done!

Now users can visit [https://slidesome.is](https://slidesome.is) or [https://slidesome.com/enter](https://slidesome.com/enter), enter the slideshow key and post media directly to your slideshow.

> Visit [https://slidesome.com](https://slidesome.com) today, create a free slideshow and get people posting!

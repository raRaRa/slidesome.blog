> The Slidesome companion app is ideal for many use cases, such as weddings, conferences, virtual events and more. People can share photos and videos directly to your slideshow, without sharing it on social media.

The Slidesome companion app has received an update to make it easier to play and remote control your slideshows. You can now sign in to your Slidesome account in the companion app to view all of your slideshows. We also improved the performance of the app, made some tweaks and fixed minor issues.

The Slidesome app has been a hit at virtual events in the past year as it allows users to easily upload and share photos without having to post to public social media networks.

  Blog website for Slidesome
</h1>

The Slidesome blog is a heavily modified version of the Gatsby blog starter. Typography has been removed and custom styles added instead.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into slidesome.blog

    ```shell
    cd slidesome.blog/
    gatsby develop
    ```

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `slidesome.blog` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!


## ðŸŽ“ Learning Gatsby

Looking for Gatsby guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the Gatsby website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.

## ðŸ’« Continuous deployment

Travis is used to build and deploy the website to S3
